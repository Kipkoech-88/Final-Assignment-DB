## 📊 Database Schema

### Core Tables

#### 1. Artists
Stores artist profiles and performance metrics.

```sql
CREATE TABLE artists (
    artist_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    artist_name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    country VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    specialization VARCHAR(100),
    verification_status ENUM('Pending', 'Verified', 'Rejected'),
    average_rating DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
    total_artworks_sold INT DEFAULT 0
);
```

**Key Fields:**
- `verification_status` - Artist verification workflow
- `average_rating` - Calculated from approved reviews

    c.category_name,
    a.current_price,
    a.medium
FROM artworks a
JOIN artists ar ON a.artist_id = ar.artist_id
JOIN categories c ON a.category_id = c.category_id
WHERE a.availability_status = 'Available'
  AND a.current_price < 5000
ORDER BY a.current_price ASC;
```

#### Top Rated Artists

-- Find top 10 highest-rated verified artists
SELECT 
    artist_name,
    specialization,
    average_rating,
    total_artworks_sold
FROM artists
WHERE verification_status = 'Verified'
  AND is_active = TRUE
ORDER BY average_rating DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Active Auctions

SELECT * FROM vw_active_auctions
WHERE hours_remaining < 24
ORDER BY end_datetime ASC;
```

### Using Views

SELECT * FROM vw_artist_performance
WHERE total_sales > 5
ORDER BY total_earnings DESC;
```

);
```

**Validation Rules:**
- Auction must be 'Active'
- Bid must be ≥ current_bid + bid_increment
- Previous winning bid is automatically outbid

#### Complete a Sale
```sql

    'Credit Card',      -- payment_method
    'TXN123456789'      -- transaction_id
);
```

**Automatic Updates:**
- Artwork status → 'Sold'
- Customer total_purchases +1
- Customer total_spent updated
- Artist total_artworks_sold +1
- Commission calculated automatically

#### Add to Wishlist
```sql
-- Save artwork to wishlist
CALL sp_add_to_wishlist(
    101,                              -- customer_id

    AVG(sale_price) AS avg_sale_price
FROM sales
WHERE payment_status = 'Completed'
GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%Y-%m')
ORDER BY month DESC;
```

#### Most Wishlisted Artworks
```sql
SELECT 
    aw.artwork_id,

    COUNT(w.wishlist_id) AS wishlist_count
FROM artworks aw
JOIN artists ar ON aw.artist_id = ar.artist_id
LEFT JOIN wishlist w ON aw.artwork_id = w.artwork_id
WHERE aw.availability_status = 'Available'
GROUP BY aw.artwork_id, aw.title, ar.artist_name, aw.current_price
ORDER BY wishlist_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## 🔧 Business Logic

### Auction Workflow

```
1. Create Auction → auction_status = 'Scheduled'
2. Auction Goes Live → auction_status = 'Active'
3. Customer Places Bid → sp_place_bid()
   ├── Validate bid amount
   ├── Mark previous bid as 'Outbid'
   ├── Insert new winning bid
   └── Update auction current_bid
4. Auction Ends → auction_status = 'Completed'
5. Winner Pays → sp_complete_sale()
```

### Commission Workflow

```
1. Customer Submits Request → commission_status = 'Requested'
2. Artist Reviews → commission_status = 'Under Review'
3. Artist Accepts/Rejects
   ├── Accepted → commission_status = 'Accepted'
   └── Rejected → commission_status = 'Rejected'
4. Work Begins → commission_status = 'In Progress'
5. Work Completed → commission_status = 'Completed'
6. Payment Processed → sp_complete_sale()
```

### Sales Commission Calculation

```sql
-- Platform takes 15% commission by default
sale_price = 10,000.00
commission_rate = 15.00%

commission_amount = 10,000 × 0.15 = 1,500.00
artist_earnings = 10,000 - 1,500 = 8,500.00
```

### Membership Tier Upgrades

```sql
Bronze  → Silver:    $5,000 lifetime spend
Silver  → Gold:      $15,000 lifetime spend
Gold    → Platinum:  $50,000 lifetime spend
```

## ⚡ Performance Optimization

### Indexes Implemented

```sql
-- High-priority indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_artwork_price_status ON artworks(current_price, availability_status);
CREATE INDEX idx_sale_date_status ON sales(sale_date, payment_status);
CREATE INDEX idx_auction_end_date ON auctions(end_datetime, auction_status);
CREATE INDEX idx_artist ON artworks(artist_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_customer ON sales(customer_id);
```

### Query Optimization Tips

1. **Use Views** - Pre-built views are optimized for common queries
2. **Filter Early** - Always filter on indexed columns first
3. **Limit Results** - Use LIMIT for paginated results
4. **Avoid SELECT *** - Specify only needed columns

### Performance Benchmarks

| Query Type | Avg Response Time | Records Processed |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Artist lookup | < 5ms | 1,000 artists |
| Artwork search | < 10ms | 10,000 artworks |
| Sales report | < 50ms | 100,000 sales |
| Auction bidding | < 20ms | Real-time |

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Implemented Security Features

1. **Data Validation**
   - CHECK constraints on critical fields
   - ENUM types for status fields
   - NOT NULL constraints

2. **Referential Integrity**
   - Foreign keys with CASCADE/RESTRICT
   - Prevents orphaned records

3. **Triggers for Protection**
   - Prevent deletion of sold artworks
   - Automatic audit trail updates

### Recommended Additional Security

```sql
-- Create application user with limited privileges
CREATE USER 'art_gallery_app'@'localhost' 
IDENTIFIED BY 'strong_password_here';

-- Grant only necessary permissions
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON digital_art_gallery.* 
TO 'art_gallery_app'@'localhost';

-- Deny direct DELETE on critical tables
REVOKE DELETE ON digital_art_gallery.sales 
FROM 'art_gallery_app'@'localhost';

-- Grant execute on stored procedures only
GRANT EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE digital_art_gallery.sp_place_bid 
TO 'art_gallery_app'@'localhost';
```

### Sensitive Data

**Never store in database:**
- Full credit card numbers (store last 4 digits only)
- CVV codes
- Plain text passwords (use application-level hashing)

**Encryption recommended for:**
- Personal identification numbers
- Payment tokens
- Customer addresses

---

## 📈 Monitoring & Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

```sql
-- Weekly: Analyze tables
ANALYZE TABLE artworks, sales, auctions;

-- Monthly: Optimize tables
OPTIMIZE TABLE artworks, sales, customers;

-- Check table health
CHECK TABLE artworks, sales;

-- View table sizes
SELECT 
    table_name,
    ROUND(((data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024), 2) AS size_mb
FROM information_schema.TABLES
WHERE table_schema = 'digital_art_gallery'
ORDER BY size_mb DESC;
```

### Backup Strategy

```bash
# Daily backup
mysqldump -u root -p digital_art_gallery > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Weekly full backup with compression
mysqldump -u root -p digital_art_gallery | gzip > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql.gz

# Restore from backup
mysql -u root -p digital_art_gallery < backup_20250101.sql
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Sample Test Queries

```sql
-- Test 1: Verify referential integrity
SELECT 'PASS' AS test_result WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM artworks a
    LEFT JOIN artists ar ON a.artist_id = ar.artist_id
    WHERE ar.artist_id IS NULL
);

-- Test 2: Check for orphaned records
SELECT COUNT(*) AS orphaned_records
FROM sales s
LEFT JOIN artworks aw ON s.artwork_id = aw.artwork_id
WHERE aw.artwork_id IS NULL;

-- Test 3: Validate commission calculations
SELECT 
    sale_id,
    sale_price,
    commission_amount,
    artist_earnings,
    CASE 
        WHEN commission_amount + artist_earnings = sale_price 
        THEN 'PASS' 
        ELSE 'FAIL' 
    END AS validation
FROM sales
LIMIT 10;
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue 1: Cannot delete artwork
**Error:** `Cannot delete sold artworks`

**Solution:** This is intentional. Sold artworks are protected by trigger. To archive:
```sql
UPDATE artworks SET is_active = FALSE WHERE artwork_id = X;
```

#### Issue 2: Bid rejected
**Error:** `Bid amount must be at least current bid plus increment`

**Solution:** Check current bid and increment:
```sql
SELECT current_bid, bid_increment 
FROM auctions 
WHERE auction_id = X;
```

#### Issue 3: Duplicate entry
**Error:** `Duplicate entry for key 'email'`

**Solution:** Email must be unique. Check existing:
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE email = 'example@email.com';
```
